            <h3>How does the 30-day free trial work?</h3>
            <p>You can use Pulse absolutely free for 30 days. After 30 days,
                we will charge the credit card you used when you  sign up. If
                you choose to cancel your account before your trial ends, your
                card will not be charged
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>What is a “Financial Account”?</h3>
            <p>Financial Accounts are a grouping of income and expense
                items that can be used for tracking or reporting purposes.
                
                They're designed to be flexible and can be used to
                differentiate between bank accounts, companies, individuals
                or between personal and business entries.
                </p>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>Will | be able to cancel my account if I don't use Pulse?</h3>
            <p>Yes - you can cancel your account at any time. To cancel your
                account, go to your billing page and click on “Please cancel my
                account” at the bottom of the page. The account owner is the
                only one who can cancel an account. An email request to
                delete an account is not considered cancellation.

        <div class="question">

                will be billed the new amount on the date of your next billing
                cycle.
